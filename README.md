## :page_facing_up: Explanation
The project is a challenge proposed by the Academy leaders in the GCB Group. It was performed through a Pair Programming.

The project is for a website that presents weather information from anywhere in the world, with the option of choosing that location through the search field. It displays the location's humidity information in percentage, the wind speed, the current location's // weather and how many degrees. In addition to presenting an icon simulating time.

It gives you the option to watch the forecast for a few days in the future. So you can click and switch to view future options.

The graph changes as the user chooses the desired location or the day he wants to see.

The data is being consumed from an API called WheaterAPI which offers some services for projects like this or even bigger.

## 📁 Pages

The site has one page, which is:

- **Main:** The main page is the only one of the project and it presents some information, such as: a hero section displaying some CTA buttons, a section that briefly introduces me, a section that show my skills and projects and a section that has a contact form.

## ⚔️ Challenge

In this challenge, you have to build a website that will show the weather in places around the world! The application must be built using the consumption of an API that will provide the necessary data to display on your website. A very good challenge to learn the whole context of front-end applications using React.
